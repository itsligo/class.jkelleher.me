###Exceptions
Exceptions are a mechanism for handling unexpected events to your application whilst running. Exceptions impose a performance penalty so are reserved for those rare events.

Puran Mehra provides a simple [introduction](http://www.c-sharpcorner.com/UploadFile/puranindia/ExceptionHandlingCsharp07082009014725AM/ExceptionHandlingCsharp.aspx) on [C# Corner](http://www.c-sharpcorner.com/). MSDN also has a [summary](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms173160.aspx) page for Exceptions. And Bob Tabor via [Microsoft](http://channel9.msdn.com/Series/C-Fundamentals-for-Absolute-Beginners/21) has a good video.

Sivaraman Dhamodharan on [Codeplex](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/125470/Exception-Handling-for-C-Beginners) hosts a very compact example showing how exceptions percolate up the call stack to where they are eventually handled.

###Generic Collections
As we move up the food chain in terms of storing data in memory objects, we encounter generic collections. These are special collections that are strongly typed - by that I mean that you can specify the type of data that they can store. This restriction is welcome as it ensures that any attempt to store something other than the proposed data type will prompt a compile-time error and not a run-time.

As previously, Bob Tabor offers a good [video](http://channel9.msdn.com/series/C-Fundamentals-for-Absolute-Beginners/22) on the various types of generic collections. We'll concern ourselves mostly with List<T> and ObservableCollection<T>, though gradually you'll see more use of variations like ICollection<T>, IEnumerable<T>. Stack<T>, SortedList<T> and Queue<T>.
