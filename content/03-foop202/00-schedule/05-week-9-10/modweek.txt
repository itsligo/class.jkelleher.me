LINQ is equally capable to T-SQL and we look at increasingly realistic queries pulling varying datasets from the database. LINQ actually comes in two flavours - query syntax and method syntax. The former is similar to conventional T-SQL. Method syntax is typically more expressive and succinct but at the expense of being somewhat more convoluted in appearance.

We also work with the UI to improve the ways in which we can display and interact with the data retrieved. This involves primarily working with **DataGrid** and other **ItemsControl**-like controls.
