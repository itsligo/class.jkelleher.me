Text: HCI402 tackles the user experience and the various phenomenon that surround it. We look at techniques to better understand the user's perspective, work up prototypes, test designs, appreciate psychological and physiological aspects to user interfaces design.

HCI402 (link:https://amm.itsligo.ie/module/webview/COMP/COMP08099/201200/999999 text:syllabus) is taught to BSc. (Hons.) Computing (Software Development), Year 4. HCI is fast becoming a key feature of computer science study.
