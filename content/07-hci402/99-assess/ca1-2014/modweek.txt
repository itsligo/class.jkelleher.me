I have provided commentary specific to each submission (below) but provide some general observations here also. Remember the marks available to this element of CA are relatively few but the points I make here will obviously impact more with CA2 and beyond.

**Student Rental Site**
Much improved presentation (don't forget Student IDs and your programme of study). Trying to describe the layout and justification thereof of a screen without the screen alongside is difficult. Keep you discussion of the UI in context by using annotated 'screen'-shots. Some mixing of past, present and future tense in your narrative? Methodology well explained. Though not explicitly asked for, a video recording the interaction might have been an option.
The screen mockups lack a context - by that I mean there is no navigation to other features or 'chrome' for your site for branding. The 'Add some bills included' etc. buttons are questionable particularly on the first page - are they buttons? The wizard-like navigation for this task is good. Why no contact details for landlord? Photos page looks incomplete - how are photos added.
Though the write-up for the landlord task is mostly complete, there is very little on the remaining tasks. There is some review of those tasks but little regarding the process followed by users in completing the tasks.
The presentation of reviews is also questionable - very little space to view is provided and no hint as to how to navigate to see more. Also, 'Rating' label appears twice on AddReview.png. Could examine ways to present more snippets of reviews - perhaps scrolling snippets after a set amount of time. 

**College Printing Service**
Kudos for employing video. I would recommend some 'rig' to steady the camera and preserve focus next time around. Also, there were many reusable elements to the page which would reduce the amount of 'page flipping' that can be a distraction (particularly in video). Document is well presented (just add Programme of study in future). TOC welcome. Keep the 'Introduction' high-level and avoid getting into the detail that more rightly follows in the sections below (e.g. choosing of users to test).
Highlight the current screen by indicating this on the menu system. The 'Top-up' task is under-whelming as it achieves little other than information on locations to go to topup.
The History page probably shouldn't show current printing pages. Also, unsure of the usefulness (or practicality/security/confidentiality) of allowing past documents to be reprinted. Should there not be more detail on these documents - where printed, size, cost etc. Page doesn't appear to make good use of space. 
The Help page could be regarded as something that should not be necessary if the design were successful. Notwithstanding this, perhaps help would be better incorporated into the main print, history, topup panels.
The descriptions of the test subjects is quite vague and sheds little light on their experience. Some good observations re the siting of the testing.
The tasks presented are all relatively unchallenging or their presentation is such that the task is not taxing. For example, downloading a past document did not address the liklihood that the user doesn't recall the name of the document, or date of printing. The prototype presumed that the document they were looking for was the only one presented on screen. This over-simplifies what can be an onerous task. Even the simple aspect of where to download to are ignored.
The 'hard task' of wirelessly printing: should this not rightly be treated as an option on the main printing page.
There were some reasoned consideration of feedback from users and how this might be improved upon in future revisions. 
 
**Susi System**
Presentation very good (perhaps overly long), complete, structured, well described. Tasks were well-elucidated using ample description and explanation. Justification for design descisions woven nicely into the text and in context. Very complete, perhaps even overly ambitious for lo-fi prototype. Qualitative feedback documented and clearly related. Would welcome a little more reflection on foot of findings from task exploration with users. Good work.

**Gov.ie**
Generally, reasonably well presented. Do employ figure captions and numbering and reference these clearly in the text. Copious sketches are welcome. Avoid casual language like 'bringing it into the 21st century' and 'could use some work' - best to be specific and authoritative.
Unsure of arrangement for complaints - seems you're doubling up on navigation - does not the home page have navigation to various departments in any case? Similarly, did you consider a typehead control for lookup? On confirmation page, could provide custom message since system will know if user provided email and/or tel number.
Pg 10 makes a leap in finding the appropriate service. There could be hundreds of 'things to find' or 'things to apply' for - unsure if 'find' and 'apply' dichotomy is the way to go. Equally fig on pg 11 appears over-simplified and offers little by the way of context or navigation to other parts of the site and the density of information is low. Equally, the Gov.ie chrome persists - is this not an overhead once the user finds the destination department. Figs on pg 12/13 underscore this imposed restriction on data content.
Task 3 seems very similar to Task 2 - 'apply' rather than 'find'. It does introduce a breadcrumb trail -was there a reason why not in Task 2? Pg 15 details how to narrow your search but one approach requires that you know the department responsible for the task you're seeking, which you may not know. The other suggested approach is a search box but there is little detail on how this would work. For example, Google is successful (or viewed as more so than Bing) because it employs sophisticated criteria for selection of the results - you place the same reliance on your results but this is not explained. Pg 17 shows a good greeting page. However, pg 18 loses the context of the form and removes all navigation other than the search box (for all of Gov.ie?) and the 'Next' button. I do note that pg 20 brings the breadcrumbs back. I acknowledge you noted this in your follow-up comments.
The setup on pg 23 is good. The reflection on your design and the input of the users is welcome. Overall, I think your treatise is good but he overall design is limited and doesn't comprehend the diversity of tasks that a Gov.ie site would need to accommodate.

**Codiqa
Needless marks lost for poor document presentation - no page number, biblio, figure/table captioning/referencing, and submission details (class/date/module). Task 1 is reasonably simple but would benefit from greater clarity - the problem isn't well defined or scoped so it makes it difficult to evaluate unless you are familiar with Codiqa.
Task 2 shows promise. However, again, the context is missing - you show and refer to a pop-up box for both the current and proposed designs. This lacks detail about how this box is arrived at and how the box fits into any redesign.
Similarly, in Task 3, the concept of a 'theme' is not explained or even defined. The series of screen shots does help a little though. However, your proposed redesign is poorly elucidated.
I did not find any evidence of the screen elements that would be employed during the interviews nor any indication of how the screen elements were presented or sequenced.

####Overview

The goal of this assignment is to learn how to use low-fidelity prototyping in the early stages of UI design. You will first build a low-fi prototype and then perform a simple usability test. You will incorporate the results of the test into design changes in your prototype for the next assignment.

####Requirements

Now that you have had a chance to work with your teammates and develop your project idea, create a team mission statement that describes your goal for the project.

Your test will use the three (3) tasks that you turned into scenarios in the last assignment (unless I ask that you change them). These benchmark tasks should include 1 easy task, 1 moderate task, and 1 hard task. These tasks should give good coverage of your interface and should be non-trivial. For example, the user registration process on a web site is well-defined so do not choose such a well-established task. Instead, choose a task that is unique (or close to) to your application/web site.

Design and construct your low-fidelity prototype. Use the techniques described in the “Prototyping for Tiny Fingers” paper as a guideline. You may choose to design your low-fi prototype either on paper or using a wire-framing tool like SketchFlow or Balsamiq or Codiqa or Justinmind or Conceptboard. (See the Prototyping page for more)

You will find at least three (3) participants (volunteers who are not in your group) to work through your benchmark tasks. You should avoid using friends or other members of the class. The type of people you use should be based on your task analysis. Remember it must be voluntary. You should get them to sign an informed consent form saying the test will be confidential.

####Testing Procedure

The participant will be given a short demo of how to work with someone “playing computer”. Do not show them exactly how to perform your tasks. Just show how the system works in general and give an example of something specific that is different enough from your tasks. Your lo-fi prototype should therefore have reasonable coverage, typically horizontally if not vertically also in places.

You should write-up a short script of your demo and follow the same script with each participant. The participant will then be given task directions for the first task that tells him/her what they are trying to achieve, not how to do it. When they are finished, you will give them the directions for the next task and so on. Keep each task on a separate card.

During the experiment, a team member should log critical incidents (both positive and negative events). For example, the user might make a mistake or they might see something they like and say, “cool”. Write it down along with a description of what was going on at the time. Later you should prioritise these events and assign severity ratings to the problems.

Each participant will perform all 3 tasks. You will want to keep the data separate for each task and participant.

####Deliverable

Your writeup (~2000 words) should follow the outline below:

* Each team member’s name, role, and a URL to an online copy of this essay
* Introduction and Mission Statement (150 words)
* Prototype description, with copious sketches and a picture of the entire system (400 words)
* Method (50 words)
* Participants (50 words)
* Environment (50 words)
* Tasks (250 words)
* Test Procedure (150 words)
* Results (250 words)
* Discussion/Analysis (400 words)
* Appendices (as many pages as necessary – link from text into the appendices)
* Writing and Experimentation Guidelines

####Marking Scheme
* Report preparation and presentation (20 marks)
* Evidence of depth of understanding of task domain and user supports required (30 marks)
* Prototype design (40 marks)
* Interpretation of feedback from test users (10 marks)

This CA contributes 12% of overall CA (30%).

####Introduction and Mission Statement

Briefly introduce the system being evaluated, and state the purpose and rationale behind the experiment. Then, present your mission statement. The mission statement should represent the common purpose and goal of the project.

####Prototype

Describe your prototype thoroughly. Reference sketches of the interface screens in your description. Show full sequence of screens required to complete set tasks. Finally, take one picture (for a paper prototype) or screenshot of the entire system with all of its elements laid out. You will find these wireframing toolkits useful to help mockup your prototype screens. Effort will be required to prepare these sequences of screen mockups to ensure the task flow is clear. You may choose to use something like Conceptboard for this - document the link to any online walkthroughs clearly in your writeup.

####Method

Describe the participants in the experiment and how they were selected. Also describe the testing environment and how the prototype and any other equipment were set up. For many, this will be quite trivial.

Describe some details of your testing procedure. This should include the roles of each member of the team. To prepare for the experiment, you should assign team members to the different tasks (i.e., computer, facilitator, etc.) and practice with someone playing the participant.

You should concentrate on process data (i.e., what is happening in the big picture) in addition to some bottom-line data (i.e., time or # of errors) but bear in mind this is a low fidelity mockup of the final product and emphasis on timings is not recommended. Show your findings and how they will inform your next design iteration. Make clear what you have learned and how your design remedies the problems found.

####Results

Summarize & present clearly the results of the experiment from your process data. Use charts where appropriate, perhaps to indicate key pressure-points in your design.

####Discussion

Discuss your results and reflect on your assumptions and design. What did you learn from the experiment? How will the results change the design of your interface? Was there anything that the experiment could not reveal?

####Appendix

The appendix should include copies of all materials involved in the experiment. This includes your consent form, demo script, and any instructions or task descriptions you handed out or read out loud to your participants.

Finally, it should include all the raw process data you gathered during the experiment. Merge the critical incidents logged by the observers and list them here. The word count does not comprehend appendix materials and screen shots.
