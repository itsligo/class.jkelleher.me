###Timer
Just as introducing the Random class earlier helps to make apps more engaging, **DispatcherTimer** helps to enhance your applications.

**DispatcherTimer** is a simple timer class for WPF. For a simple tutorial go [here.](http://zamjad.wordpress.com/2011/10/10/using-dispatchertimer-class/)

A **DispatcherTimer** needs to have an **Interval** set and responds to the **Start()** and **Stop()** methods. The **Interval** property is of type **TimeSpan**. An event handler needs to be wired up to the **Tick** event to intercept it and handle any custom code.

###Canvas Layout Panel
We won't use the **Canvas** control much but it makes for a very simple panel where you have a need for absolute coordinates - that is, positioning elements at specific x- and y-values. Read a little more [here](http://wpftutorial.net/Canvas.html).

###More on Classes
Classes form the basis for everything we do in OO programming so you'll need to know how to work with them from an early stage.
