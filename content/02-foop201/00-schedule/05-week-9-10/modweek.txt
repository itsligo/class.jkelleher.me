####More UI Controls
We look at how to use RadioButtons, Combo-boxes, Grid-splitters, Border, Checkbox and Image. Each of these will typically require code-behind to handle user interaction with the control. We look at ways to mediate this access.

####ItemsSource
Todate we've used the **Items** property to push and pull data into/out of **ListBoxes**. This is problematic as you (the programmer) are required to ensure that the **ListBox** is an accurate reflection of the data in your 'database' or collection of data.
We look at **ItemsSource** as another means of working with the contents of a **ListBox**. This alleviates us of the responsibility of continually re-populating the contents of a **ListBox** when the values changes.

####Static keyword
The **static** keyword in C# (and other languages) serves a few roles so it's important to understand its distinct usage. MSDN provides a (link:http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/79b3xss3%28VS.80%29.aspx text:comprehensive account) though it's a keyword best explored through examples we'll work on in class.

####File Handling
Now that much of the basics are covered, we turn our attention to persisted storage - manipulating files on hard drives, typically. This leads to the manipulation of files in general in the next lesson and in a later semester, we'll focus on accessing data in databases which are the backbone of virtually all business applications.
We'll learn how to browse the contents of a directory (folder) and parse collections of files to be found there. We'll introduce the notion of Streams to be explored in detail later.

####Dialog Boxes
We'll also enhance our ability to improve the look of our user interface. First, we'll look to including bitmaps into our display from files on the hard drive. We'll also show how to code pop-up dialog boxes to solicit data from users, passing this data back to the program. We'll also use special built-in dialog boxes to find files, save to files and print.
