(link:http://www.murach.com/index.htm text:An excellent book on C#) at this level is Joel [Murach]()'s book Murach's [C# 2010](http://www.murach.com/books/cs10/index.htm). It is current with developments in .NET 4.0 and works well for those  not too confident with C#. Murach's approach is unique presenting topics example  by example in a very clear layout.

Programmers' Heaven free [ebook](http://www.programmersheaven.com/ebooks/csharp_ebook.pdf) is a  first class resource for C#. There are other resources at this site (C# School)  that are suited to beginners. Do note that this book however covers only some  aspects of .NET 2.0. Beware of this issue since many resources on the web on C#  target .NET 1.1 or earlier whereas many new changes in 2.0 render earlier  material obsolete.
