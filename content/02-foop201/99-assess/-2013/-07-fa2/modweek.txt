Text:

A simple (simpler than FA1) app that 'races' cars.

(image: img1.png title: screenshot)

* Begin by creating a simple UI modelled on the screenshot.
* Then create a **Car** class to represent the racing car. A **Car** has a cc (engine size) and a 'name'.
* A slider is used on the screen to represent the movement of each **Car** along a track.
* The movement along the 'track' is progressed on the **Tick** event of a **DispatcherTimer**.
* Use a **Random** class object to decide on how much each **Car** moves.
* On each **Tick**, check to see if any **Car** has won.
