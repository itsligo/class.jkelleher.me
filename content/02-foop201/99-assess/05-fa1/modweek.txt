Create a basic WPF Application to maintain a list of expenses incurred. Each expense will have the following attributes:

* expense category (one of 'Travel', 'Entertainment' or 'Office')
* cost (must be 1 cent or more, to max of €100)
* date incurred (must be a date within 30 days of today's date)

Your UI should show a list of **Expenses**. A button at the bottom of the screen will add another Expense. Use a **ListBox** to show the expenses on screen and each expense should be displayed similar to this:

> Travel: €23.35 on 3/8/2015

The **ListBox** should be pre-populated with a handful of **Expenses** on program startup. As such, these **Expenses** must be auto-generated randomly. This obviates the need for the user to enter any data.

At the bottom of the screen, provide a total for all **Expenses** beside the button to add another. Use some styling to decorate your UI.
