Text:
Write an app to display the working hours of a number of **Employees**. Each **Employee** object will have a name and a number for hours worked. Your app should display the employee names and the number of hours worked by each - the names should drawn randomly from a collection of names (hard-coded), while the number of hours worked by each should be randomly chosen from the range 20-60. The number of Employee objects displayed should also be randomly decided, in the range 5-15.

At the bottom of the screen there should be summary information detailing the total number of hours worked, summed for all Employees shown.

Use a **Data Template** retrieved from the **ResourceDictionary** to display the Employee's **Name** and **HrsWorked** as shown opposite.

On the left, display the details of the currently selected **Employee** in the listbox.Â Additionally, there should be a swatch (small box of color) reflecting the amount of hours worked, colored as follows:

*   Green, where < 30 hrs
*   Amber, where >=30 and <50 hrs
*   Red, where >=50 hrs

Use a **IValueConverter** to implement this. Create the colours from code rather than attempt to retrieve them from the **ResourceDictionary**.

A Button should allow for the collection of Employees to be re-generated.

Use basic styling to present this information in a pleasing fashion. Use XAML resources to keep your code easy to read and maintain. Use binding expressions wherever possible to simplify the UI (user interface). Employ a layout approach that ensure the display scales well when resized. You must employ a separate ResourceDictionary file which should hold (at a minimum) a **LinearGradientBrush**, a **Data Template** and a **SolidColorBrush**. Use the **LinearGradientBrush** somewhere in the display.
