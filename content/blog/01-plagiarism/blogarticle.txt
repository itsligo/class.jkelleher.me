**Update Sept '14:**
Following assessment of autumn repeats in PRJ300/400, I would encourage all students to carefully review the outline of plagiarism below. Remember the presumption among assessors of your work is that it is all your own work and that you represent it as such. By all means, employ the work of others to assist you in your endeavours but you **must** credit this work in your submitted documentation (in the bibliography) both as an ethical obligation and often as a legal one.

Plagiarism is using othersâ€™ ideas and words without clearly acknowledging the source of that information. In submissions from a student all work is assumed to be that of the student him/her-self save that which is cited as belong or derived from another specified source. To represent the work of another as that of your own is plagiarism and is subject to sanction by the college authorities.

Equally sanctionable is to make available to another student work that is then represented as their own, or to collude in the submission of work which is then represented as the work of one person solely.

Under the Student Charter (available on demand or via the college website), you as a student are responsible to inform yourself as to the regulations governing your study at the college. Part of that responsibility is to be aware of the regulations governing plagiarism. Ignorance of the regulations is not a defense.

Remember, in the absence of clear citation of the origin of any submitted work, the assumption by your examiners is that this is your own work presented for assessment and credit. After an allegation of plagiarism has been lodged against your work, it is too late to provide a citation of the source. The matter is then referred to the Registrar/Student Disciplinary Committee.
