####Directions
This exercise brings together a number of previous topics and introduces some  new ones to cover the following:

*   The Binding object
*   DataContext
*   DataTemplate
*   Property change notifications
*   Validation (including ValidationRule and  ValidationAdorner)
*   Converter
*   DataTrigger
*   MultiBinding
*   Binding to subproperties

This app provides an eBay like experience. The initial screen  shown opposite lists items for auction. It is possible to add a new item through  a pop-up window.

The items are listed with a distinct presentation according to whether it is  bordered in a colour or with a star alongside. Each item is associated with a  category drawn from the following list:

*   Books
*   Computers
*   DVDs
*   Electronics
*   Home
*   Sports

Begin by creating a class **AuctionItem** which handles the details of a  single item for auction. This class should implement the  **INotifyPropertyChanged **interface to ensure updates are propagated to  the interface.

You will need to create suitable classes for **User** and **Bid** to support the main **AuctionItem** object.
