Text:
Write an ASP.NET MVC application that employs manages job applications. The application will have the following features/functionality:

* Each **Job** consists of a **Title** and a **StartDate**.
* Each **Job** will have an associated number of Applicants. Each **Applicant** has a **Name** and **YrsExperience**.
* Your app's home page will list each **Job** along with a list of the Applicants on that **Job**.
* The user can add a **Applicant** to a **Job** by clicking a button alongside the name of each **Job**. You do not have to provide a separate page/form to ask for details of this **Applicant**. Just provide controller code to create an **Applicant** (any Name/YrsExperience will do), add it to the database and redisplay the view.
* Clicking on the name of the **Job** sends the user to another page displaying the **Title** of the **Job**, the average number of years experience of the applicants, and a link back to the home page, suitably formatted.
* The app will begin with 2 **Jobs** - one **Job** will have **two** Applicants and the other will have none. Seed the database to provide this data.

Additionally ensure you adhere to the following technical requirements:

* Use Entity Framework Code First to generate a database corresponding to your model classes
* Seed the database as described above. Do so in an effective manner
* Provide robust code that defends against errors particularly wrt database access
* Reward is provided for exceptional coding that (e.g. performant, robust, elegant)
* You should employ whatever features of the Bootstrap >3.0 framework that you feel would enhance the UI but balance this against the marking scheme
* Be sure to enable Nuget (link: http://docs.nuget.org/docs/workflows/using-nuget-without-committing-packages text:restore) for your Solution to avoid pushing the large packages folder to Github.
