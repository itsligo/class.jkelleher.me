Write an ASP.NET MVC application that employs manages job applications. The application will have the following features/functionality:

* Each **Job** consists of a **Title** and a **StartDate**.
* Each **Job** will have an associated number of **Applicant**s. Each **Applicant** has a **Name** and **YrsExperience**.
* Your app's home page will list all **Applicant**s (their **Name** and **YrsExperience**) in a table. The **Title** of the **Job** they have applied for should also be present on the row.
* Clicking on the **Job** mentioned in the previous bullet takes the user to a screen showing all the **Applicant**s for that **Job**. The average number of years experience of the applicants for that **Job** and a link back to the home page, suitably formatted are also required.
* The app will begin with 2 **Jobs** - one **Job** will have **two** Applicants and the other will have none. Seed the database to provide this data.

Additionally ensure you adhere to the following technical requirements:

* Use Entity Framework Code First to generate a database corresponding to your model classes
* Seed the database as described above. Do so in an effective manner

* Reward is provided for exceptional coding that (e.g. performant, robust, elegant)
* You should employ whatever features of the Bootstrap >3.0 framework that you feel would enhance the UI but balance this against the marking scheme
