Write an ASP.NET MVC application that employs manages summer camps for kids. The application will have the following features/functionality:

* Each **Camp** consists of a **Title** and a **StartDate**.
* Each **Camp** will have an associated number of children. Each **Child** has a **Name** and **Sex** (M/F).
* Your app's home page will list each **Camp** (sorted by **StartDate**, most recent first) along with the number of children on that **Camp**. If there are no children on the **Camp**, display 'None'.
* Display a styled button alongside each **Camp** which when clicked leads to a 'Details' page. This page displays the **Camp** name and a table of the children on that **Camp**. Provide a button to return the user to the 'Home' page.
* The app will begin with 3 **Camps** - one **Camp** will have **two** children and the others will have none. Seed the database to provide this data. Do this properly using a database initialiser class.

Additionally ensure you adhere to the following technical requirements:

* Use Entity Framework Code First to generate a database corresponding to your model classes
* Seed the database as described above. Do so in an effective manner
* Provide robust code that defends against errors particularly wrt database access
* Reward is provided for exceptional coding that (e.g. performant, robust, elegant)
* You should employ whatever features of the Bootstrap >3.0 framework that you feel would enhance the UI but balance this against the marking scheme
* Be **sure** to enable Nuget (link: http://docs.nuget.org/docs/workflows/using-nuget-without-committing-packages text:restore) for your Solution to avoid submitting the large packages folder along with your solution.
* Your zipped solution should be <3mb; if not, ensure you have followed the above points.
