Write an ASP.NET MVC application that employs manages training courses for employees. The application will have the following features/functionality:

* Each **Course** consists of a **Title** and a **StartDate**.
* Each **Course** will have an associated number of staff. Each **Employee** has a **Name** and **Department** (one of Sales, Support, or Research).
* Your app's home page will list each **Course** (sorted by **StartDate**, most recent first) along with the number of staff on that **Course**. If there are no employees on the **Course**, display 'None'.
* Display a styled button alongside each **Course** which when clicked leads to a 'Details' page. This page displays the **Course** name and a table of the employees on that **Course**. Provide a button to return the user to the 'Home' page.
* The app will begin with 3 **Course**s - one **Course** will have **two** staff members and the others will have none. Seed the database to provide this data. Do this properly using a database initialiser class.

Additionally ensure you adhere to the following technical requirements:

* Use Entity Framework Code First to generate a database corresponding to your model classes
* Seed the database as described above. Do so in an effective manner
* Provide robust code that defends against errors particularly wrt database access
* Reward is provided for exceptional coding that (e.g. performant, robust, elegant)
* You should employ whatever features of the Bootstrap >3.0 framework that you feel would enhance the UI but balance this against the marking scheme
* Your zipped solution should be <3mb; if not, ensure you have followed the above points.

</connectionStrings>
```
