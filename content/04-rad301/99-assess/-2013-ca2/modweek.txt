Text:
An ASP.NET MVC application that employs the Northwind database. The application will have the following features/functionality:

* Use Bootstrap 3.0 CSS framework extensively to style web page elements, supplanting any CSS offered by VS2012 templates (remove traces of site.css)
* Establish data connection with Northwind and generate a DAL to the data using Entity Framework
* Initial (Home) page will display a list of **Orders**. 
* Improve the display of the **Order** details by amalgamating some of the shipping details rather than display a number of distinct columns - join the pieces together but impose some upper limit on the size of shipping detail text.
* Show the Contact name for the company by whom the **Order** was placed, on each row with each Order.
* Clicking on an order will display details of the **Employee** who is associated with the **Order**. Have these (few) **Employee** details displayed in a panel to the right of the table of **Orders**. Use Ajax and a partial view to accomplish this. Bonus marks for using (link: http://api.jquery.com/category/effects/ text:jQuery) to liven things up with perhaps some animation.
Ensure you name the boss (another **Employee**) to whom the displayed **Employee** reports.
* In the **Employee** details pane, provide a button to redisplay the same page but listing only those **Orders** associated with that displayed **Employee**.
* Provide a link for each **Order** to edit the details of that **Order**. Provide dropdown listboxes for **Shipper** and for **Employee** so that these associations can be changed for an **Order**.
* Provide a link for each **Order** to delete it. Offer a confirmation box to handle this. Best to use Bootstrap pop up window for this.

Other Points to note:

* You may use Entity Framework
* You should employ whatever features of the Bootstrap framework that you feel would enhance the UI but balance this against the marking scheme
* Use of a master page (i.e. layout.cshtml) and partial views are encouraged
* Provide robust code that defends against errors particularly wrt database access
* Reward is provided for exceptional coding that (e.g. performant, robust, elegant)

####Marking Scheme
* Styling (use of Bootstrap etc.)                    <span class='pull-right'>**20 marks**</span>
* Controllers, data retrieval/querying, Ajax, LINQ<span class='pull-right'>**30 marks**</span>
* Constructing Views and using Razor View engine<span class='pull-right'>**30 marks**</span>
* Good programming practice, innovative approach<span class='pull-right'>**20 marks**</span>

####Upload
Use Git (including Github or alternative) to manage your work. Follow the procedure outlined in my [post](/blog/git-assess) regarding submission. Be sure to enable Nuget (link: http://docs.nuget.org/docs/workflows/using-nuget-without-committing-packages text:restore) for your Solution to avoid pushing the large packages folder to Github.
I will assume you will use the repo address you provided earlier. Be careful that you use a new branch CA2 for this assignment. Use 'git branch -d branch_to_delete' to delete a local branch (more on my blog (link:http://jkwp.itsligo.ie/blog/git text:post)).
It is important that you use Git from the beginning of your work and do regular commits so that I can see the work being added over time. Expect to push every hour or so.
