For end-Semester exams 2014, please ensure you follow the following instructions before uploading your work:

* Do **not** use Git - if you did enable Git, enable showing all files and delete the **.git** folder
* Right-click on the Solution (not Project) and **enable** NuGet Restore
* Delete the bin folder
* Delete the obj folder
* Delete the packages folder
* Zip your entire solution folder - this file should be only 2-3Mb at most. Unzip again if you like to confirm all your files are there.
* Keep a copy of your work - you are not permitted to have usb stick or other external storage in the exam room but save to H.
* You can email yourself a copy (since there are no executables left in the zip, this should work fine) but do not subsequently open.
* Ensure you receive a confirmation email after you upload your work.
