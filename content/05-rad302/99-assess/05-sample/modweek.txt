This app consumes two aspects of (link: https://developers.google.com/maps/ text: Google Maps) to assist in the display of the location of (link: http://gokemon.site90.net/tutorials/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Northwind.png text:Northwind) data.

Specifically, I use Google Map (link: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/ text: Geocode) to look up the longitude and latitude of a given address. The address is sourced from the shipping address of a selected Order.

* The Orders are retrieved via Entity Framework from a copy of Northwind held locally. These records are returned using conventional MVC and surfaced in a View attached to the Home Controller.

* When the user selects an Order, the shipping address for that Order is retrieved. This is done via a Web API which surfaces the data held in the database (again via EF).

* The client makes an Ajax JSON call to retrieve the address which is then displayed to screen.
* The address is also passed to Google Maps Geocode API to try to identify the longitude and latitude of the address. If successful, the co-ordinates are then passed to Google Maps to render a map to the screen.
