###Javascript Client Frameworks
In recent years, another approach to web applications has gained significant interest. Instead of relying on the server application to manage much of the processing (database querying, business logic & presentation of data), much of the work is relegated to the client where Javascript provides the processing. This has many advantages particularly in respect to responsiveness (fewer post-backs to server) and separation of concerns.
Popular frameworks include Angular (Google), Ember and Backbone ([comparison](http://readwrite.com/2014/02/06/angular-backbone-ember-best-javascript-framework-for-you))

####AngularJS
[AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) is a Javascript framework for building rich responsive client web applications backed by a dedicated team at Google and 800 open-source contributors. Key [features](http://angular-tips.com/blog/2013/08/why-does-angular-dot-js-rock/) include:

* Data binding and scopes
* Directives - extending standard HTML
* [Filters](http://toddmotto.com/everything-about-custom-filters-in-angular-js/) - sort and filter data client-side
* [Services](http://weblogs.asp.net/dwahlin/using-an-angularjs-factory-to-interact-with-a-restful-service) - singleton classes that provide application-wide functionality
