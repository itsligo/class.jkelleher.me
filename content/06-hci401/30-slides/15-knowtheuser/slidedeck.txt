#Basic Activities of Interaction Design

* It is a process:
    * a goal-directed problem solving activity informed by intended use, target domain, materials, cost, and feasibility
    * a creative activity
    * a decision-making activity to balance trade-offs
* Four approaches: user-centered design, activity-centered design, systems design, and genius design
---
# Importance of Involving Users
* Expectation management 
	* Realistic expectations 
	* No surprises, no disappointments
	* Timely training
	* Communication, but no hype
* Ownership 
	* Make the users active stakeholders
	* More likely to forgive or accept problems
	* Can make a big difference to acceptance and success of product
* Participation
    * Cycle users
    * Design workshops/Evaluations
---
# User-Centered Design
* User-centered approach is based on:
    * Early focus on users and tasks: directly studying cognitive, behavioral, anthropomorphic & attitudinal characteristics 
    * Empirical measurement:  users’ reactions and performance to scenarios, manuals, simulations & prototypes are observed, recorded and analysed
    * Iterative design: when problems are found in user testing, fix them and carry out more tests
---
#Design must...

* Ackowledge who the users are
* Support the activities being carried out
* Appreciate where the interaction is taking place
* Optimize the interactions users have with a product
* Match the users’ activities and needs

#Interaction Design

#### "Designing interactive products to support the way people communicate and interact in their everyday and working lives"

.quoted[Sharp, Rogers and Preece (2011)]

#### "The design of spaces for human communication and interaction"

.quoted[Winograd (1997)]

###Professionals in Interaction Design

* interaction designers
    * people involved in the design of all the interactive aspects of a product
* usability engineers
    * people who focus on evaluating products, using usability methods and principles
* web designers
   * people who develop and create the visual design of websites, such as layouts
* information architects
    * people who come up with ideas of how to plan and structure interactive products
* user experience designers (UX)
   * people who do all the above but who may also carry out field studies to inform the design of products

##Who are Users/Stakeholders?

* Not always obvious:
    * direct users
    * managers of direct users
    * users further downstream consuming output
    * those commissioning
    * prospective customers to attract

* Three categories of user (Eason, 1987):  
    * primary: frequent hands-on
    * secondary: occasional or via someone else
    * tertiary: affected by its introduction, or will influence its purchase
---
##Defining 'Needs'
* Users poor visionaries
* Users can’t  tell you what they ‘need’ to help them achieve their goals 
* Instead, look at existing tasks:
    * their context
    * what information do they require?
    * who collaborates to achieve the task?
    * why is the task achieved the way it is?

##How to choose between alternatives

* Prototype - field test your ideas cheaply and quickly
* Technical feasibility: some just not possible or skills in short supply
* Quality thresholds: Usability goals lead to usability criteria set early on and check regularly
safety: how safe?
    * utility: which functions are superfluous? 
    * effectiveness: appropriate support? task coverage, information available
    * efficiency: performance measurements

###Interaction Design is iterative

* cycling through various design processes and different levels of detail
* thinking through a design problem
* understanding users needs
* coming up with possible models
* prototyping models
* evaluating them
* thinking about design implications
* making changes

### Categories of User
* Novice
    * frequent feedback
    * actions prompted by choices
    * safe exploration supported - robust
    * easy undo
    * selective disclosure
* Intermediate
    * knowledge of broad aspects
    * need easy access to the details
    * can be amalgam of novice and expert
* Experts
    * critical help system user
    * lower, more subtle support and feedback
    * accelerators required
    * customisability desired
    * experts less risk-averse in usage pattern
---
##Categories of User (Anecdotal)
* Novice user
    * someone who is afraid if they touch the keyboard they will break the system
    
* Intermediate user
    * someone who has broken the computer and doesn’t know how to fix it
    
* Expert user
    * someone who breaks other people’s computers

###Affinity Diagramming
#### Participatory method where concepts written on cards are sorted into related groups and sub-groups.

* Diagnose complicated problems by organising qualitative data
* Analyze findings from field studies
* Identify and group user functions as part of design
* Analyze findings from a usability evaluation

###Scenarios
* an informal narrative story, simple, ‘natural’, personal, not generalisable
* illustrate using storyboards
* sequences of sketches showing screens & transitions
* good to demonstrate to management, marketing and customers can replace much textual specification
* similar to Use Cases in Software Engineering
* examples of Scenarios ([Adam Torres](http://www.adamatorres.com/gallery-project/?page_id=271))
.footnote[
Reading: [Scenarios](http://infodesign.com.au/usabilityresources/scenarios/)]
---
###Personas
#### Detailed descriptions of typical users and their backgrounds
* Understanding the user
* Clarifying assumptions
* Fully exploring the design
* Providing a context for reviewers
* Helping other project tasks
* Best Buy: roster of shopper profiles:
    * Buzz (the young tech enthusiast)
    * Barry (the wealthy professional man)
    * Ray (the family man)
    * Jill (a soccer-mom type, main shopper for family but usually avoids electronics stores)
