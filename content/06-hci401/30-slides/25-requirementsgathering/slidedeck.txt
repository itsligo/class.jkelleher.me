##### Charles Ormond Eames, Jr (1907–1978)
##### Bernice Alexandra "Ray" (née Kaiser) Eames (1912–1988)

##Interview with Charles Eames 1/3
* What is your deﬁnition of design?
    * "A plan for arranging elements in such a way as to best accomplish a particular purpose"
* Is design an expression of art (an art form)?
    * "The design is an expression of the purpose. It may (if it is good enough) later be judged as art."
* Does the creation of design admit constraint?
    * "Design depends largely on constraints."
---
##Interview with Charles Eames 2/3
####"What constraints?"

####"The sum of all constraints. Here is one of the few effective keys to the design problem -- the ability of the designer to recognize as many of the constraints as possible - his/her willingness and enthusiasm for working within these constraints - the constraints of price, of sized of strength, of balance, of surface, of time, etc; each problem has its own peculiar list."

##Interview with Charles Eames 3/3

###"Does design obey laws?"
--

###"Aren’t constraints enough?"

--
###There are no rules of good composition in design.
###Only good designs.
---
###Why Requirements Gathering
* Explore the fundamentals of interfaces and the interaction design process
* Practice the fundamental concepts, methods, and practices of interaction design. 
* Practice “form follows function” and “be the user”
* Explore how products create experiences, and understand the role that interaction with products fulﬁlls in human existence
* Learn to present design ideas
* Learn to critique design ideas
---
### Data Gathering Methods

* Questionnaires
* Interviews
* Focus Groups
* Naturalistic observation
* Extant documentation
* Contextual Enquiry
---
##Why do Requirements
* Uncovered information may lead to:
    * abandoning a bad idea
        * video-phones, recipe management programs
    * very good ideas
        * Window usage matches a working set model – E.g. Rooms
    * basis for driving design
    * protects from building a useless program
* Often assumptions designers have about users and interface are wrong

##Data Gathering Techniques
* Data Recording
* Interviews
* Questionnaires
* Observation
---
##Data Recording
* Notes
* Audio
* Video
* Photographs
---
##Interviews
* Unstructured
    - are not directed by a script. Rich but not replicable. 
* Structured 
    - are tightly scripted, often like a questionnaire. Replicable but may lack richness.
* Semi-structured 
    - guided by a script but interesting issues can be explored in more depth. Can provide a good balance between richness and replicability.
---
##Interview Technique
* Open vs. Closed Questions
* Avoid leading questions
* Beware unconscious biases
* Use props/prototypes
---
##Questionnaires
* Questions can be closed or open
* Closed questions are easier to analyze by computer
* Can be administered to large populations, low cost
* Paper, email and the web used for dissemination
* Sampling can be a problem when the size of a population is unknown as is common online
---
##Questionnaires
* Make sure purpose of study is clear
* Assure anonymity
* Do pilot run to verify design
* Consider a shorter version
* Include a stamped addressed envelope if posted
* Consider follow-up with emails, phone calls
* Provide an incentive/reward/stoyr
* 40% response rate is high, 20% is often acceptable
---
##Observation
* Direct observation in the field
    - Structuring frameworks
    - Degree of participation (insider or outsider)
    - Ethnography
* Indirect observation: tracking users’ activities
    - Diaries
    - Interaction logging
---
##Observation - Structuring
* The Goetz and LeCompte (1984) framework:
    - Who is present?
    - What is their role?
    - What is happening?
    - When does the activity occur?
    - Where is it happening?
    - Why is it happening?
    - How is the activity organized? 
---
##Ethnography
* Investigation approach that include participant observation and interviews
* Be aware of conflict between participant observation and ethnography
* Immersion in the culture of the organisation
* Analyzing video and data logs can be time-consuming
* Collections of comments, incidents, and artifacts are made

    * Gather all necessary information
* Environment Requirements
    * Consider noise, lighting, privacy
* Functional Requirements
    * Respondents unkowningly betray existing problems
* Usability Requirements
    * Efficient, intuitive, accessible E.g. [(Kord Pad)](http://www.korddefence.com.au/Images)

###Example: University Cafeteria
####Factors influence requirements in this instance?

* Functional: The system will calculate the total cost of purchases
* Data: Access to the price of products in the cafeteria
* Environmental: Carrying tray, likely rushing, noisy, busy, users conversing with one another
* User: Likely <25, comfortable with technology.
* Usability: Readily accessible, friendly to neophytes, memorable for frequent user, quick, efficient, remedy errors quickly
