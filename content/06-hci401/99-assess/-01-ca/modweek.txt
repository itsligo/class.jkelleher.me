###Overview

CA is concerned with analysis and early design of a given problem space and task. You should first select a product for consideration, possibly from the following list. You will then use the contextual inquiry methodology to learn more about the work practices of your target users. The interviews will help you perform a task analysis of your idea. Finally, you will design sketches (screen mockups) of your proposed user interface. Consult the class calendar for due date.

####Idea for CA

* Car Pooling
* Clothes retail site
* Photo ordering site
* Photo (media) gallery
* Music-download website
* Tivo Inteface
* Kiosk Image Printer
* Guitar Tutor application
* Online voting/survey site
* Online assignment submission system
* Home Media Server
* Second-hand book site
* Scanning software
* Theatre Booking Application
* Media Player Application
* Selling Advertising Slots on TV/Radio
* Telephone call show organisation
* Flower Sales site
* Video Editing Suite
* Estate agency site
* Online Arcade site

Your assignment is to identify an application similar to one of the above to form the basis of a project for the remainder of the year. You will conceive, design, develop and evaluate an interface for your chosen idea. You should observe the need for good human-centered design in interactive computer systems and analyse problems that you encounter. Should you wish to choose one of the above ideas, a small penalty (3%) will be imposed - by way of encouragement to broaden the range of ideas.

Given that this choice of idea is the basis for the rest of the assignment it is important that your choice of idea will require an interface of sufficient complexity to sustain your later work. If in any doubt, consult me or you may find (as has happened) you need to change ideas during the year and incur extra work.

###Deliverables

You will submit an report of approx. 3500 words with accompanying diagrams etc. in addition to this. It should follow the outline below.

* Problem and solution overview (150 words)
* Analysis of problem domain and consideration/critique of extant solutions (600 words)
* Contextual inquiry interview descriptions and results writeup (600 words)
* Task analysis questions (500 words)
* Analysis of new and existing tasks (800 words). Six (6) tasks your application will support (2 each of easy, moderate, difficult)
* Interface design (400 words): Functionality summary (what you can do with it) User interface description and sketches (how you use it) * Three (3) scenarios of example tasks with sketches
* Any additional sketches
* Observations & Conclusion (200 words)

####Problem or Idea
Describe the problem(s) that your project will seek to solve. Take the user’s point of view. Consider what the user’s goals are, and what obstacles lie in the way. Note the project ideas above are not problems—they’re solutions.
Identify the kinds of tasks that you would foresee as necessary/useful to the user(s). Avoid vague goals – detail the many tasks that you expect such a system to support. Though it is reasonable for a given system to support a very limited set of tasks, in this instance, I favour more complicated systems that have a good range of supported tasks since this assignment will be expanded upon and needs an inherent complexity to support later assessment.

####Analysis
Characterize the user population that faces the problem you’re trying to solve. Give more background for the problem or new idea. It doesn’t just focus on the negative aspects of the current situation, but also identifies some positive aspects that may be beneficial to retain. A few salient examples from existing systems or work practices should be used to support those claims. Relate the user environment within which the proposed system will operate. Consider the user, their background, the tasks' data requirements, the environment of use, connectivity with other applications/users. Reflect on the other systems that your proposed system might/should integrate with and to what benefit. You need not provide a whole end-to-end solution –  instead you may wish to focus on part of the chain of tasks required to achieve an overall goal.
You should consider alternative solutions currently available for this particular problem space and debate the relative merits/demerits of these.

####Suggested Improvements
Describe a possible solution to the problem—i.e., the interface that you envision, and how it will address the problem. You aren’t absolutely committed to your solution, since you may find after building and evaluating some prototypes that a wholly different solution will work better.
Refrain from hardware solutions as these may be problematic to design/prototype later – focus on software solutions for which available prototyping tools will readily support. Be critical but realistic in your appraisal of competitive alternatives – do not overlook the reasons for current designs – elaborate on the insight these alternative approaches reveal so that you can better inform your future designs.
Sketch your ideas – these can be very ‘rough’ and are readily disposable but will help articulate and communicate your ideas (to me as well as to your group and future users). Ensure these sketches are scanned clearly enough so that I can zoom and make out the detail.

####Contextual Inquiry Process

* Interview at least two (2) target users (not class members) using contextual inquiry. Use a usability interview consent form.
* Answer the standard task analysis questions.
* Analyse new and existing tasks. Describe six (6) tasks in moderate detail that users will perform with your application. There should be two (2) each of easy, moderate, and difficult tasks. Compare and contrast your tasks with any existing tasks.
* Based on your analysis and tasks, explain your proposed interface. Describe in text and support your description with  sketches of important screens. You may need to use several sketches in sequence and properly annotated to convey the dialog with the program.
* Choose one each of your easy, moderate, and difficult tasks and develop a scenario for each, total three (3), that describes how they will be performed using your user interface.

Describe the rationale behind your choice of target users. For each of the two users, give some details of their background, the environment where you observed their work, and your role as the “apprentice”. Identify tasks and themes that the users shared in common in their work practices. Then, note anything unique about each interview and comment on the rationale behind these events.

Answer the standard task analysis questions – Who? (e.g. background, skills, physiology) What? (task now/desired, interaction with: people, objects, data) Where? (environment, static/mobile) Why? (motivations - intrinsic/extrinsic) When? (timing, frequency). Use examples from your interviews when applicable.

Next, you need to analyze the new and existing tasks. These should be real world tasks replete with details (e.g., programming the VCR to watch 'The Simpsons' on Tuesday). The tasks identified should be realistic, grounded in your analysis of the problem domain and confirmed through your interviews. In selecting the tasks to document, you should avoid trivial or well documented tasks such as 'Login' screens. Equally, even the 'easy' tasks have to justify your design effort. Don't ignore the possibility of taking a perceived difficult task and making it an 'easy' one by respecifying a design goal. For example, the task of invoking a backup task could be radically simplified by having the system monitor change patterns in files and more regularly backup those regularly changed files automatically.

Give a rationale for your design ideas. This section should clearly indicate the functionality of your artifact and what the user interface will be like (described and sketched — references the figures in your text). You should then describe three scenarios of how someone would use it to accomplish three of the tasks above. Scenarios include the steps users will go through to accomplish the task. You should include “storyboards” of the sequences described in your three scenarios. It is important that the sequence of actions necessary to progress the task is clearly evidenced in your mockups. Pay particular attention to labelling, annotations of screens, numbering and referencing in the text.
