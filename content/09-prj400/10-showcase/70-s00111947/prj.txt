Shortdesc:
A 3D superhero style RPG

Description:
I will be developing a fully open 3d world style RPG(Role Playing Game). I will be developing the game in Unity using C#. I plan to have a character and class creation system and a set area of an open world free to explore. You will level up different powers and abilities through playing and there will be a set amount of missions. I will be creating my own assetts for the game and will be doing all of the coding myself.
