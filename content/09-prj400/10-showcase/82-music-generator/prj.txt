Title: Music Generator
----
Shortdesc:
Windows phone music player
----
Description:

Windows phone music player which plays local music files and also streams music.
The local file player will record player history to help with auto generated playlists and smart shuffle.
The app will also have the option to stream music by creating playlists. A WCF web service or web API will be used to create these platlists 
with multiple options ie:
    based on music in local collection
    player history
    querying on-line api's for recommendations
    music tempo 
A database will continually record information of the app's usage for example time of day or if a track was skipped to further refine playlist generation.
The purpose will be to have a player that keeps track on user usage to try 'know' what music the user wants to hear
