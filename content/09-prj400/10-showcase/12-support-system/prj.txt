Title: Support System
----
Shortdesc:
Open Source web based application.
----
Description:
The aim of the project is to develop an application which will be used for tracking technical 
support. The application will allow users to register/ or login to create support case with detailed information 
about it (the case number, time created, case type, general information about the case, and if the case is closed or 
still open). After creating the case- user will be able to print or copy to local computer all information about the 
case. Also- the dashoboard for a user account will be created, so when he/she log in to a system- a list of all casses 
will be displayed and available to view. The email can be sent directly from an application, after creating 
a case.
I aim to create a reusable application that can be used with any business website which may need an online 
support/ tracking system availbale for business customers.
