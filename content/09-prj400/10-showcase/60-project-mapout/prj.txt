Title: Project Map-Out
----
Shortdesc:
A feature-rich mobile application enhencing walkability and combining augmented reality for Older Adults
----
Description:
The aim of this project is to make streets more age friendly and change the way planners look at planning infrastructure.
We want an app to: 
* Find location and Outline nearby spots (cracked footpath etc.) on the map,
* Let Users to provided Hazard Spots info,
* Let User to see marked obstacles information - distance to the obstacle and its type through the camera.
* Let User to take a photo of the spot with some problem, select what the problem is (maybe rate it).
* show nearby public toilets and sitting areas.
* Find my car or starting location as an extra feature (many possibilities to enhance the experience).
* find the best route that would avoid (if possible) problematic spots
* visualise the hazards better thanks to camera rather than through a map scenario. This may also be easier to adapt across other platforms easier (although we feel that a cross platform app would be left aside at this stage.)

A website will be built in conjunction with the app which would display collected data for the public view and for the councils
* Councils should be also able to add walking obstacles information as well (e.g. footpath closed in certain spot due to road works between 25 and 30 September).
* Councils should be able to edit existing data (eg. Problem fixed)
Website should also have a Page with a challenge for councils.
At the moment we are thinking about page that would let user to create a Mock up of design for for certain part of the street
User would be able to drag and drop elements to the mock up window and when finished - system would rate the mock up
according to. This ment to be an educative experiance.
