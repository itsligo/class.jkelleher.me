Title: ICAMM (In Car Arduino Assisted Media)
----
Shortdesc: An in car media centre with the usual media such as Radio, Cd, Dvd playing that also uses Arduino to control fan speed and temperature and take useful readings from the car to display to the user. 
----
Description:The aim of the project is to develop an in car media centre that allows the user to play their media from various devices through an easy to use WPF application. If time allows Bluetooth connectivity with a phone will also be implemented. The application will be displayed on a 12" monitor that will replace the centre console of the cars dashboard. An Arduino will be used to control the fan and temperature controls and these can then be adjusted on the touch screen monitor. Three gauges on the bottom of the screen will show the battery voltage and hopefully the oil pressure and oil temperature.
