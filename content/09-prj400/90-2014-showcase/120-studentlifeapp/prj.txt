Description:An Android Application to help students keep track of their finances and not to overspent in the month.  This will hopefully be achieved with the help of Voice Recognition. Also, a feature to enter your college timetable and will get a notification 10/15 before the class begins as to never miss class again. This feature will also include being able to enter project deadlines and receive notifications when they are near.
