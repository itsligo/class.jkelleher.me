#####Prj400 is typically undertaken individually (though groups are occasionally entertained). Though different streams will ‘flavour’ the work differently, this module is essentially about analysing a problem, exploring the design space, building and testing a solution and documenting your work effort. Your (link: prj400/begin/supervisor text: supervisor) will provide guidance but the work is the responsibility of the student group. The major efforts are:

- Analysis:
Identify and document the problem that you are solving. You must identify the stakeholders, the tasks undertaken by them and the problems associated with a given solution (including current approaches).
- Design:
Propose, debate and document design decisions. You must show that you have considered several ways of solving the issues associated with the project. Use the (link: prj400/begin/project_log text:project log) to document these decisions, discussions and conclusions.
- Prototype:
Where appropriate develop a low-fidelity prototype to illustrate a test implementation of your final chosen design. This should not be a ‘coded’ solution but rather employ one of many tools to present your design.
- Build & Test:
Use appropriate tools and frameworks to realise your designs. Document your testing plan and outcomes.
- Presentation:
Communicate your achievements, problems encountered and how you sought a solution. Show documentation of your efforts and sell your solution convincingly to the review panel.
