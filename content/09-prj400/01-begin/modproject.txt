Text: ###Beginning PRJ400
#####Prj400 represents a substantial independent body of work typically undertaken individually. The module aims to encourage innovation and a wider exploration of the field of study. It emphasises the importance of a high level rigorous and demanding approach to, and a strategy for the development of the chosen deliverable. It also helps to apply, to a deeper level, the techniques and concepts learned throughout the programme, including the technical skills of analysis, design and implementation.

Teams will be created very early in the semester. The team will agree an outline project (link: prj400/begin/ideas text:idea), or one will be assigned to you by your supervisor. Once you have an agreed idea, work begins.

The type of deliverables for Project 400 vary in concert with prior learning and chosen domain of the group as well as resource constraints. For software engineering students, for example, the deliverable will normally consist of documentation (requirements specification, use cases, scenarios, low−fidelity prototypes) and a working application of the finished software. For students of the Game Development stream, it could consist of game asset creation, storyboarding, level design, low−fidelity mockups of game play and an implemented solution.
The intent is to provide students with a simulation of a real−world project along with the management issues (of time, people, resources and skills) and fixed deadlines that accompany it.
An introductory slide show will answer some of your questions regarding the project.
