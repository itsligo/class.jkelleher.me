#####A supervisor is assigned for each project usually with consideration for the subject matter involved. It is expected of the project team/individual to meet on a weekly basis with the supervisor and use him/her as a sounding board for new ideas and major developments within the project. If the project team member(s) fail to fully engage with the supervisor, it tends to have a detrimental effect on the end result.

Each student will be required to maintain on a regular basis a (link: prj300/begin/project_log text:project log) documenting progress throughout the module. This will be monitored by the supervisor and form part of the overall evaluation. In Prj300, your supervisor will assign a project should you fail to agree one by the appointed deadline.

Your supervisor will be your first port of call for any project related matters. You should make weekly contact with your assigned supervisor. Your project log can also act as a conduit for discussion. Your supervisor will also attend a sprint review meeting (or similar if using another project management framework) to offer feedback.

Currently, there is provision for 30min per student per project at Level 8 and where teams of 4 are employed, there is an allocation of 90 minutes per week. It is important that you make the most of this time.
