#####Documenting your work as you proceed is an important part of the design/development process. It serves as an insight into the work that you have done and in that way aid a fuller assessment of the module. More importantly though, it allows you either as an individual or collectively as a group to record design decisions and give you an opportunity to reflect on the choices made and the direction taken. This reflection can help keep a project focussed on the end-goal and avoid project creep, help delegate responsibilities (within groups) and better plan for outcomes within the timeframe of the module.

(image: wordpress_logo.png alt:Wordpress title:WordPress class:img-right) For these reasons, a project log is mandatory. However, do regard this log as part of your submission’s documentation so you’re locking in marks as you go. Remember too that if operating in a group, marks for individuals may well vary reflecting the input from each member.

(link: http://www.wordpress.com text:WordPress.com) is probably the best choice for keeping a log. It’s quick, free and easy to setup and use. There’s a wide choice of themes to make your site distinctive. Don’t confuse this site with wordpress.org which provides a more sophisticated self-hosting solution, one not necessary for this requirement. Send your log URL along to me and I’ll list it here so that your supervisor can chart your progress and offer comments via the site.

Keep your wordpress blog public. Employ (link: http://en.support.wordpress.com/posts/categories text:categories) to help organise the various posts into meaningful collections – for example – evaluation, coding, design, testing etc. Avoid ‘indulging’ too much in your log to the detriment of actually getting things done but be watchful for notable achievements, breakthrough, insights that are worthy of inclusion.
