#### Project Management
(image: ScrumDiagram.png title:Scrum) 

(link: http://scrummethodology.com text:Scrum) is an iterative, incremental framework for project management often seen in agile software development but is often used in other domains. Key features of the approach are:

- suits projects where final deliverables are subject to change or are ill-defined at the outset
- setting of product backlog – a prioritised list of the elements necessary to the final delivered product
- sprint – a period (2-4 wks) during which a subset of the product backlog, called a sprint backlog, is worked to deliver a potentially deliverable product increment, that is, a working (albeit possible limited) version of the final product
- defined accountablity – at each weekly team meeting individuals are called to account for their tasks and explain progress
