Title: Group WristWatch
----
Shortdesc:
A wristwatch panic alert
----
Description:
The aim of the project is to develop a  wristwatch type divice where
it will allow the emergency services to find the exact location of the wristwatch bearer.
When the user presses the button on the wristwatch for 3 seconds (to allow no human error) 
it will send out the person's id and GPS to the call centre. The call centre then sends the 
location and the persons information to the ambulance. (There may be an addition of sending
the information to relatives and neighbours of the wristwatch bearer).
