Title: SPMS
----
Shortdesc: A Web application for group and project management
----
Description:

The aim of the project is to develop a Web Application which allows a lecturer to put students in groups for projects. 

When the group is being created he/she can search for students in a course through profiles of their students and add them to the new group.

This then sends out an E-mail to all members of the group with information on the project/task.

The group can then access a group section which will have a calendar which will have the Due/Finish date. 

The calendar will then be able to be added to by members of the group to keep track of progress and problems.
 
The group section can be accessed by lecturers who created the group allowing them to keep track of progress. 

This should be beneficial for students and lecturers to help organise groups and to assist in the supervising of groups.

Other site functionality will be added as required.
