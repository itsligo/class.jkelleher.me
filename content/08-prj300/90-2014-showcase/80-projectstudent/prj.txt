Title: Project Student
----
Shortdesc: Student assistance app for helping new students settle into IT Sligo.
----
Description: Mobile app to assist students in settling into IT Sligo, including timetables, campus maps, communication facility and native, improved student hub.
We will parse the timetables to make them offline usable, with editing and re-organizing on-device from there. Maps will be maps of room locations, possibly leveraging GPS to show some sort of route to the rooms.
We'll also show where the actual blocks are, as some students have difficulty locating some of the less used blocks.

An improved, mobile-friendly version of the existing Student Hub will be included, with improved navigation (e.g. going directly to email, instead of having screens in-between).
Credentials will also be stored, so the user won't have to re-enter email credentials, for example.
There will also be a communication utility for communicating with other students, class reps, etc.
