Shortdesc:Home Automation with Arduino
----
Description:An Arduino based home automation system that will be controlled by an Android, iPhone or Windows Phone via a web app. It will enable the user to control a household by giving the user access to all electrical systems that are connected to the Arduino Microcontroller. Such systems may include a buildings lighting system, electrical sockets, alarm systems, door/window sensors and other systems that can be integrated into an Arduino interface. 
The system will be controlled by an in-house developed App which will enable the user to carry out tasks such as turning on/turning off lights,setting mood lighting/event lighting, arming or disarming alarm systems, receiving status reports such as weather information and getting a general overview on the household from an electrical standpoint.
