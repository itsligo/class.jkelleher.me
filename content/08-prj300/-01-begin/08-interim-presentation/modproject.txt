#####The interim presentation offers the opportunity to put your work to date before a panel to gain feedback and assessment.

The date for the interim presentation is usually just before Christmas and is posted to the project calendar.

There is no formal documentation/code required to be submitted for the interim presentation but you would be expected to have blog entries describing your work to date. You may prepare a short Powerpoint presentation but it would typically be better to limit this to one or two pages. 

Ensure all members represent themselves and their work so all should have a part to play at the presentation. It's often best to have each team member speak to a particular part of the work, presumably that part they accomplished.

Practice your presentation so that your deliver takes approx. 5 minutes. The panel present will follow up with questions to tease out the content of your work.
Generally, we would expect some 'product' at this point - usually this is code but would typically also include (perhaps) screen/game/level/database design, evidence of research as well as some more intangible items such as experience/understanding of various concepts.

Be sure to discuss your presentation (both interim and final) with your supervisor ahead of the day as he/she will be best placed ot advise you.
