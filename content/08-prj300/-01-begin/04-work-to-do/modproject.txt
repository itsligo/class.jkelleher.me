#####Prj300 is undertaken by groups of four. Though different streams will ‘flavour’ the work differently, this module is essentially about analysing a problem, exploring the design space, building and testing a solution and documenting your work effort. Your (link: prj300/begin/supervisor text: supervisor) will provide guidance but the work is the responsibility of the student group. The major efforts are:

- Team management
Begin by (link: prj300/begin/choose-team text: choosing a team). As a team you must continually delegate work to those best suited. You must manage who is responsible and account for the work noting deadlines and deliverables. Marks are based on this and all members will be penalised if accountability cannot be identified. You might find project management tools useful for this. Learn more about managing your team and working with your (link: prj300/begin/supervisor text: supervisor).
- Analysis:
Identify and document the problem that you are solving. You must identify the stakeholders, the tasks undertaken by them and the problems associated with a given solution (including current approaches).
- Design:
Propose, debate and document design decisions. You must show that you have considered several ways of solving the issues associated with the project. Use the (link: prj300/begin/project_log text:project log) to document these decisions, discussions and conclusions.
- Prototype:
Where appropriate develop a low-fidelity prototype to illustrate a test implementation of your final chosen design. This should not be a ‘coded’ solution but rather employ one of many tools to present your design.
- Build & Test:
Use appropriate tools and frameworks to realise your designs. Document your testing plan and outcomes.
- Presentation:
Communicate your achievements, problems encountered and how, as a team, you sought a solution. Show documentation of your efforts and sell your solution convincingly to the review panel.
