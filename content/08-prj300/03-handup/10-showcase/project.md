para1: This project employs angularJs as a client-side javascript framework. We built a standard online store using both AngularJS and a combination of other libraries to offer a comprehensive service.

para2: Each team member was tasked with a distinct part of the project and we met regularly to keep track of the progress. Weekly meetings helped to identify problems before they became too large and enabled us to deliver on the product within the timeframe specified.

para3: The project idea originated with Alan who was approached by a local business to help withi their IT needs. We saw an oppotunity to align our objectives with those of the organisation and at the same time further our knowledge.

para4: The biggest challenges came from the integration of various technologies though the exposure to such libraries greatly enhanced our understanding of the industry.
