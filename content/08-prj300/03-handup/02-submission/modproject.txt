#####The focus of PRJ300 is to expose the processes required to perform analysis and design of a chosen product, be it a web site, desktop application, network configuration etc. The submitted documentation should report on those processes and includes:

* Individual report – one from each member of the team
* Team report – one only for the whole team
* Peer Assessment – you must have on record your vote for your other team member. If unsure that this has been registered you must make contact with me.
* Deliverables – depending on your project choice, it is likely that you will need to submit design documents (e.g. database design, network schematic) and/or prototypes (low or high fidelity, e.g. web site mockup) or other expressions of your design.

You should consult the [Assessment](/prj300/handup/assessment) for more detail regarding the format of the documentation.

NOTE: Please follow these simple instructions exactly. Projects will only be accepted for adjudication if they are submitted according to these guidelines. Late submissions may not be accepted or if so, will be subject to a penalty of 10% of overall mark. Remember, the presentation contributes to your mark but without a proper project submission, no mark can be awarded.
