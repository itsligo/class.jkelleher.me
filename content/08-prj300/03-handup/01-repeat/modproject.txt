#####This article provides guidance for those who have failed PRJ300. As is the norm for all repeat modules, you will need to apply to the examinations office to ‘resit’ the module assessment. This is your responsibility as we cannot presume that every student who fails a module will seek to repeat it. There is also a fee to pay as with any repeat module.

###When do I repeat?

You will work on your Project over the summer and submit before the first working day of September. You will need to present your work in person at start of September - failure to do so will result in no grade being submitted. Please plan for this during the first week of September.

###What do I do?

When you fail PRJ300, in the first instance you have the opportunity to **consult with your supervisor** during the pastoral days immediately after exam results are published. PRj300 is a group project but it is perfectly possible that some members will pass the module while others fail. To repeat PRJ300, you will work individually rather than in a group. Generally, repeat students will follow the objectives of the previously agreed proposal. Work submitted after the deadline is not guaranteed to be accepted. During the first week of September, you will need to make yourself available for presentation of your work (see below). While we will take into account family and work obligations, you must ensure that you make yourself known to your supervisor or me (John Kelleher) so that a time slot for your presentation can be arranged. It may be the case that student email provision may have lapsed or passwords forgotten, so again, assume your message has not been received if you do not get a response.
The requirements of PRJ300 are outlined in the module (link:https://amm.itsligo.ie/module/webview//COMP07147/201200/999999 text:Syllabus)

###What do I submit?

As PRJ300 is originally completed by a student group, the breadth and depth of the work will be less than that expected from the original project team. You will be tasked with the same requirements as described in the module syllabus – to analyse, design and build a client application, web app, mobile app, game. Naturally, the sum of your output will be scaled back compared to the expectations of a group but the learning outcomes are effectively the same.

Often, the repeat work will be very similar to the work already undertaken but perhaps taken in a different direction or expanded upon further. This allows you to build on the knowledge you have already gained. Alternatively, you can propose a completely different idea, but with the approval of your supervisor during pastoral days.

###How is it assessed?

PRJ300 will be assessed broadly the same as for your first attempt. Obviously with the absence of a group you are responsible for all aspects of the work. However, the breadth and scope of the work expected is reasonably scaled to reflect the reduced head-count. The learning outcomes and objectives agreed in your proposal frame the assessment. A (link:http://jkwp.itsligo.ie/content/09-prj400/03-handup/04-assessment/project_module_rubric.pdf text:rubric) is used to guide the overall project assessment.

As for documentation, the team report and individual report of the original PRJ300 group are replaced by a single report and the total word count recommended for this single report is 4500 words. Note however that this does not include cover pages, indices, table of contents, bibliography, diagrams, tables, design sketches etc. You should not view this number as a target but rather an indicative count.

You will not be asked to provide peer assessment.

You will as mentioned above be required to attend for a presentation at an agreed date/time between the first week of the academic year. You should make contact with John Kelleher if you have not been contacted within the first few days of September.
