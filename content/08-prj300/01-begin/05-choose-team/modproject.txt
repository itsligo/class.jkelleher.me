#####Prj300 requires teams of 4 though this may vary slightly to accommodate class sizes not of multiples of 4. Teams are free to self-select, that is, you should make efforts to identify those with whom you think you will work towards the end-goal. Remember that while your choice of team members will possibly influence the overall result, the assessment of the project will give substantial consideration to the input of the individual.

A deadline is posted to the project calendar by which you will need to have emailed to (email: kelleher.john@itsligo.ie text:me) or your assigned (link: prj300/begin/supervisor text: supervisor) the following:

- Team Name
- Team members (4 names & student IDs & streams)
- Brief team proposal
- Team Project (link: prj300/begin/project_log text:Log) url

For those that do not forward this information by the deadline, team(s) will be created from the remaining students and the formation will be final. For those who do not make a proposal, the assigned (link: prj300/begin/supervisor text: supervisor) will provide a project idea to the team. Again, this decision will be final. The intent here is to ensure that teams are formed and begin work in as short a time as possible. It is in consideration of the shorter semester timeframe and to build momentum so that the project is given as much time resource as possible to succeed.

####Managing a team

Each team should appoint one member as the team leader. In addition to their normal work as a member of the group, the team leader will play a management role. For example, the team leader should ensure that everyone is involved, that work is divided fairly and according to individual strengths, that tasks are completed on time, and that nothing is forgotten in the project. This does not at all mean that the team leader decides everything. On the contrary, the project is “owned” by the team as a whole, and the team may also find it useful to (formally or informally) appoint other leaders for specific aspects of the project, like Chief System Architect, Lead Programmer, or Head GUI Designer. However, the team leader has a specific responsibility to ensure that the group works effectively as a whole, that everyone pulls in the same direction, that the project progresses according to plan, and, ultimately, that the project goals are achieved and the prescribed deadlines met.

Working within or managing a team can be a very difficult task but a necessary one. The ‘It takes a village’ notion of software development is more true than ever where the complexity of the product is now such that an array is skills is needed to meet market expectations. A team of disparate but complementary skills can be very productive but needs managing.

Remember an important part of the assessment of your work is how well the team is marshalled and managed, reflecting the real-world realities of team-based development.

####Meetings

Each team should arrange regular times for two kinds of weekly team meetings: one meeting with their supervisor present, and one (or more) without. Read more about (link: http://workawesome.com/management/team-meeting/ text:effective) team meetings as well as tips for (link:http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/group-projects/pausch-tips.pdf text:working successfully) in teams (Randy Pausch).

The weekly meetings with the supervisor will normally be held in his or her office. It is your responsibility as a team to attend these meetings. The purpose of the meetings is for the team to report on progress since the last meeting, discuss any problems that have arisen, and plan the work that will be carried out by each member prior to the next meeting.

The weekly meetings without the supervisor will normally be held in a mutually convenient location. What goes on at these meetings is completely up to the team, but will typically involve the following:

- report of progress from individuals on their assigned work
- update of the project timeline
- reach decision on pending tasks and assign to individuals
- prioritise for next sprint review meeting
