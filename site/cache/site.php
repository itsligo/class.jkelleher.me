This module is taught currently to BSc. (Ord.) Computing (link: https://amm.itsligo.ie/programme/webview/COMP/SG_KSDEV_B07/201300/999999 text: [Software Development]) and B.Sc. (Ord.)

The focus is on developing rich interfaces using a popular declarative markup language and exploring ways to manipulate in-memory and database hosted collections of objects.

While in past years I have used WPF/Silverlight as the development platforms, 2013 saw a move away from these towards ASP.NET MVC (currently in version 5). This reflects the increasing re-orientation of MS and indeed the industry around more sophisticated web development. Note that MVC differs substantially from ASP.NET Web Forms that you may be familiar with.

ASP.NET MVC alone serves only the server side of the web equation so we will involve JavaScript & jQuery (covered previously by Software students), CSS (for styling) and a number of JS libraries to support and expedite development. While these technologies won't be universally familiar to all students, we will exploit ready-made solutions and frameworks to avoid begin distracted by the detail of their implementation.

So we bid farewell to XAML & WPF and look to ASP.NET MVC and CSS. While CSS will be familiar to Web students from Yr 2, we will employ a simple CSS Framework to automate the styling and layout of our user interfaces. This ensures that the design aspect can be addressed with minimal effort and preserve time for data querying and bedding down our understanding of data models, MVC architecture and web application development.

Text: RAD301 (link: https://amm.itsligo.ie/module/webview/COMP/COMP07149/201300/999999 text:[syllabus]) typically builds on FOOP20x taking you away from the basic building blocks of OOP and focusing on more mainstream developer concerns of UI design and building, data access, frameworks, debugging & deployment.

This module is taught currently to BSc. (Ord.) Computing (link: https://amm.itsligo.ie/programme/webview/COMP/SG_KSDEV_B07/201300/999999 text: [Software Development]) and B.Sc. (Ord.) Computing (link: https://amm.itsligo.ie/programme/webview/COMP/SG_KGDEV_B07/201200/999999 text: [Games Development]), both in year 3, Level 7. The programming language is C# in the .NET environment. The focus is on developing rich interfaces using a popular declarative markup language and exploring ways to manipulate in-memory and database hosted collections of objects.

While in past years I have used WPF/Silverlight as the development platforms, 2013 saw a move away from these towards ASP.NET MVC (currently in version 5). This reflects the increasing re-orientation of MS and indeed the industry around more sophisticated web development. Note that MVC differs substantially from ASP.NET Web Forms that you may be familiar with.

ASP.NET MVC alone serves only the server side of the web equation so we will involve JavaScript & jQuery (covered previously by Software students), CSS (for styling) and a number of JS libraries to support and expedite development. While these technologies won't be universally familiar to all students, we will exploit ready-made solutions and frameworks to avoid begin distracted by the detail of their implementation.

So we bid farewell to XAML & WPF and look to ASP.NET MVC and CSS. While CSS will be familiar to Web students from Yr 2, we will employ a simple CSS Framework to automate the styling and layout of our user interfaces. This ensures that the design aspect can be addressed with minimal effort and preserve time for data querying and bedding down our understanding of data models, MVC architecture and web application development.

This module is taught currently to BSc. (Ord.) Computing (Software Development) and B.Sc. (Ord.) Computing (Games Development), both in year 3, Level 7. The programming language is C# in the .NET environment with some detours into JS, jQuery libraries and JS frameworks.

It follows on work completed in Rich Application Development (link:rad301 text:RAD301). The focus is on building n-tier applications using modern development frameworks and ORM (object-relational mapping) tools. While the abiding allegiance is towards C# and .NET, the offering is now increasingly agnostic and embraces a number of (now related) open-source technologies and practices. We'll touch on CSS frameworks (as earlier) and jQuery & related plugins. We'll also have some exposure to JS client-side frameworks (e.g. Ember, AngularJS) and Web API, and reflect on how the role of server and client is changing. Implicit in the delivery is the introduction of the role of design patterns and their significance and implementation.

I will retain Entity Framework (currently version 5) building on exposure to LINQ in (link:rad301 text:RAD301). I will also use localDb and SQL Server but may use the Azure cloud offering instead of local servers.

Remember this is a short semester ahead of work placement so it is important that you consolidate your knowledge from (link:rad301 text:RAD301) ahead of tackling the concepts within this module.

Programmers' Heaven free [ebook](http://www.programmersheaven.com/ebooks/csharp_ebook.pdf) is a  first class resource for C#. There are other resources at this site (C# School)  that are suited to beginners. Do note that this book however covers only some  aspects of .NET 2.0. Beware of this issue since many resources on the web on C#  target .NET 1.1 or earlier whereas many new changes in 2.0 render earlier  material obsolete.";s:6:"parent";r:401;}s:13:"translatedUID";s:6:"rad302";s:13:"translatedURI";s:6:"rad302";s:7:"content";O:11:"pagecontent":1:{s:1:"_";a:6:{s:5:"title";O:8:"variable":2:{s:5:"value";s:6:"RAD302";s:6:"parent";r:401;}s:11:"description";O:8:"variable":2:{s:5:"value";s:32:"Rich Application Development 302";s:6:"parent";r:401;}s:7:"session";O:8:"variable":2:{s:5:"value";s:19:"Semester 6 (2014-5)";s:6:"parent";r:401;}s:4:"text";O:8:"variable":2:{s:5:"value";s:4958:"RAD302 (link: https://amm.itsligo.ie/module/webview/COMP/COMP07150/201300/999999 text:[syllabus]) focuses less on UI than its precursors and instead examines deeper database access issues, n-tier development, object-relational models as well as experimenting with model-view controller architecture patterns.

This module is taught currently to BSc. (Ord.) Computing (Software Development) and B.Sc. (Ord.) Computing (Games Development), both in year 3, Level 7. The programming language is C# in the .NET environment with some detours into JS, jQuery libraries and JS frameworks.

It follows on work completed in Rich Application Development (link:rad301 text:RAD301). The focus is on building n-tier applications using modern development frameworks and ORM (object-relational mapping) tools. While the abiding allegiance is towards C# and .NET, the offering is now increasingly agnostic and embraces a number of (now related) open-source technologies and practices. We'll touch on CSS frameworks (as earlier) and jQuery & related plugins. We'll also have some exposure to JS client-side frameworks (e.g. Ember, AngularJS) and Web API, and reflect on how the role of server and client is changing. Implicit in the delivery is the introduction of the role of design patterns and their significance and implementation.

I will retain Entity Framework (currently version 5) building on exposure to LINQ in (link:rad301 text:RAD301). I will also use localDb and SQL Server but may use the Azure cloud offering instead of local servers.

Remember this is a short semester ahead of work placement so it is important that you consolidate your knowledge from (link:rad301 text:RAD301) ahead of tackling the concepts within this module.

Text: HCI401 tackles the user experience and the various phenomenon that surround it. We look at techniques to better understand the user's perspective, work up prototypes, test designs, appreciate psychological and physiological aspects to user interfaces design.

HCI401 (link:https://amm.itsligo.ie/module/web/28/COMP08098/201200/999999 text:syllabus) is taught to BSc. (Hons.) Computing, BSc. (Hons.) Web Development & Creative Media and B.Sc. (Hons.) Games Development students, all at Year 4 Level 8. HCI is fast becoming a key feature of computer science study.

With performance or feature list no longer a distinguishing feature, attention is being focused on the quality of the interaction and its concomitant knock-on effects in productivity, training and consequences of errors.
