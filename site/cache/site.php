Alert: This module has been updated for 2013-14 following changes introduced in 2012-13. If repeating this module from pre-2012, you should be aware of these changes. If you need anything specific from past years, (email: kelleher.john@itsligo.ie text:email) me.

Text: RAD301 (link: https://amm.itsligo.ie/module/webview//COMP07105/201200/999999 text:[syllabus]) typically builds on FOOP20x taking you away from the basic building blocks of OOP and focusing on more mainstream developer concerns of UI design and building, data access, frameworks, debugging & deployment.

This module is taught currently to BSc. (Ord.) Computing (Software Development) and B.Sc. (Ord.) Computing (Games Development), both in year 3, Level 7. The programming language is C# in the .NET environment. The focus is on developing rich interfaces using a popular declarative markup language and exploring ways to manipulate in-memory and database hosted  collection of objects.

This module is taught currently to BSc. (Ord.) Computing (Software Development) and B.Sc. (Ord.) Computing (Games Development), both in year 3, Level 7. The programming language is C# in the .NET environment.

It follows on work completed in Rich Application Development (link:rad301 text:RAD301). The focus is on building n-tier applications using modern development frameworks and ORM (object-relational mapping) tools. While the abiding allegiance it towards C# and .NET, the offering is now increasingly agnostic and embraces a number of (now related) open-source technologies and practices. Implicit in the delivery is the introduction of the role of design patterns and their significance and implementation.

While in past years I have used WPF/Silverlight as the development platforms, 2013 will see a move away from these towards ASP.NET MVC (currently in version 4). This reflects the increasing re-orientation of MS and indeed the industry around more sophisticated web development. Note that MVC differs substantially from ASP.NET Web Forms that you will be familiar with.

I will retain Entity Framework (currently version 5) building on exposure to LINQ in (link:rad301 text:RAD301). I will also use SQL Server but may use the Azure cloud offering instead of local servers.

ASP.NET MVC alone serves only the server-side of the web equation so we will involve JavaScript & jQuery (covered previously by Software students), CSS (for styling) and a number of JS libraries to support and expedite development. While these technologies won't be universally familiar to all students, we will exploit ready-made solutions and frameworks to avoid begin distracted by the detail of their implementation.

So we bid farewell to XAML & WPF and look to ASP.NET MVC and CSS. While CSS will be familiar to Web students from Yr 2, we will employ a simple CSS Framework to automate the styling and layout of our user interfaces. This ensures that the design aspect can be addressed with minimal effort and preserve time for data querying and bedding down our understanding of data models, MVC architecture and web application development.

Remember this is a short semester ahead of work placement so it is important that you consolidate your knowledge from (link:rad301 text:RAD301) ahead of tackling the concepts within this module.

Module [syllabus](https://modules.itsligo.ie/webapps/programman/files/pdf_files/modules/2296//COMP07069.pdf). RAD301 provides a good grounding in client-side programming using WPF/XAML/C#. RAD302 broadens the discussion to include remote data access (typically using SQL Server), advanced binding and presentation, leaning increasingly towards the web environment. We also look at _n_-tier development where the separation of concerns design pattern is examined to better control remote data handling.

A number of development stacks can (and have) be used to illustrate this module. We briefly reflect on WPF/XAML/C# and how they can be used to build on the experience from the previous semester. This could be complemented with [WCF RIA Services](http://www.silverlight.net/learn/advanced-techniques/wcf-ria-services/get-started-with-wcf-ria-services) as the vehicle to implement the data access framework. Silverlight may also be used at the client end to provide experience of a web client. From 2013, we look to the established and emerging web stack using ASP.NET MVC together with CSS and JS frameworks (e.g. Bootstrap, JQuery) and data binding (using KnockoutJS) as well as other useful JS libraries to support the module objectives.

This module is taught currently to BSc. (Ord.) Computing (Software Development) and B.Sc. (Ord.) Computing (Games Development), both in year 3, Level 7. The programming language is C# in the .NET environment.

It follows on work completed in Rich Application Development (link:rad301 text:RAD301). The focus is on building n-tier applications using modern development frameworks and ORM (object-relational mapping) tools. While the abiding allegiance it towards C# and .NET, the offering is now increasingly agnostic and embraces a number of (now related) open-source technologies and practices. Implicit in the delivery is the introduction of the role of design patterns and their significance and implementation.

While in past years I have used WPF/Silverlight as the development platforms, 2013 will see a move away from these towards ASP.NET MVC (currently in version 4). This reflects the increasing re-orientation of MS and indeed the industry around more sophisticated web development. Note that MVC differs substantially from ASP.NET Web Forms that you will be familiar with.

I will retain Entity Framework (currently version 5) building on exposure to LINQ in (link:rad301 text:RAD301). I will also use SQL Server but may use the Azure cloud offering instead of local servers.

ASP.NET MVC alone serves only the server-side of the web equation so we will involve JavaScript & jQuery (covered previously by Software students), CSS (for styling) and a number of JS libraries to support and expedite development. While these technologies won't be universally familiar to all students, we will exploit ready-made solutions and frameworks to avoid begin distracted by the detail of their implementation.

So we bid farewell to XAML & WPF and look to ASP.NET MVC and CSS. While CSS will be familiar to Web students from Yr 2, we will employ a simple CSS Framework to automate the styling and layout of our user interfaces. This ensures that the design aspect can be addressed with minimal effort and preserve time for data querying and bedding down our understanding of data models, MVC architecture and web application development.

Remember this is a short semester ahead of work placement so it is important that you consolidate your knowledge from (link:rad301 text:RAD301) ahead of tackling the concepts within this module.

Module [syllabus](https://modules.itsligo.ie/webapps/programman/files/pdf_files/modules/2296//COMP07069.pdf). RAD301 provides a good grounding in client-side programming using WPF/XAML/C#. RAD302 broadens the discussion to include remote data access (typically using SQL Server), advanced binding and presentation, leaning increasingly towards the web environment. We also look at _n_-tier development where the separation of concerns design pattern is examined to better control remote data handling.

A number of development stacks can (and have) be used to illustrate this module. We briefly reflect on WPF/XAML/C# and how they can be used to build on the experience from the previous semester. This could be complemented with [WCF RIA Services](http://www.silverlight.net/learn/advanced-techniques/wcf-ria-services/get-started-with-wcf-ria-services) as the vehicle to implement the data access framework. Silverlight may also be used at the client end to provide experience of a web client. From 2013, we look to the established and emerging web stack using ASP.NET MVC together with CSS and JS frameworks (e.g. Bootstrap, JQuery) and data binding (using KnockoutJS) as well as other useful JS libraries to support the module objectives.
